# Weaponizr

A front-end framework that does just what needs to be done.

## Yet another front-end framework?

Yeah! I was playing around to explore Javascript's 'Proxy' class, which seemed
quite framework-y to me. So I learned it by building a framework.

It's designed to be minimal, unopinionated, and a relaxing antidote to complicated frameworks.
